## Introduction

The insurance claim project aims to analyze and visualize insurance claim data to gain insights into claim patterns, trends, and key factors affecting claim outcomes. By leveraging Tableau, we create interactive dashboards and visualizations to facilitate exploration and understanding of the data.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains information about insurance claims, including policyholder details, claim amounts, claim types, claim statuses, etc. The data is stored in CSV format and can be found in the `data` directory.

## Analysis

The analysis focuses on various aspects of insurance claims, such as:

- Claim frequency and severity
- Claim types and distribution
- Claim outcomes by policyholder demographics
- Factors influencing claim approval/rejection

## Visualization

We utilize Tableau to create visually appealing and interactive dashboards that enable stakeholders to:

- Explore insurance claim data from different perspectives
- Identify trends and patterns in claim behavior
- Make informed decisions based on data-driven insights
